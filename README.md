pip install fastmcp pydantic python-dotenv serpapi google-search-results


6. Run the Server
Save the main Python code (provided in previous turns) as server.py (or any other .py file name you prefer). Then, run the server using:
python server.py


The server will start and listen for requests, typically on http://0.0.0.0:8086.
ü§ù How People Can Use It
This AI is designed to work with a special kind of AI app (an MCP client). When you chat with that app, it will connect to this Event Planner AI server in the background to help you plan your event.
Here's how it generally works:
Start a chat: You'll begin by telling the AI app you want to plan an event.
AI asks questions: The AI will then ask you step-by-step questions about your event, like "What kind of event are you planning?" or "How many guests?".
You provide details: You simply respond naturally, and the AI understands your answers, even if you use common Indian terms for money or places.
Get your plan: Once all the necessary information is gathered, the AI will give you a personalized event plan and a checklist of things you'll need.
Find help: You can even ask the AI to "find wedding photographers in Chennai for a moderate budget," and it will look up recommendations for you!
